# How it started

The NRCC was started when its founders realized that there is a lack of per-U hosting space in real datacenters for homelabbers. It was formed to negotiate for racks within datacenters, then making that rack space available at a per-U rate to the cooperative's members.

# How it's going

The NRCC has a growing membership base and provides services to members across the Northeast United States.

# Timeline

## Foundation

NRCC was founded at the end of 2023 to provide services to homelabbers looking for reliable sites to run servers.

## Initial Deployment

The first deployment of NRCC resources was made to a datacenter used by one of the founders.
