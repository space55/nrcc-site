# NRCC

Welcome to the Northeast Regional Computational Cooperative (NRCC).

## What is NRCC?

NRCC is a non-profit member-owned cooperative, centered around hosting internet infrastructure. It started as a project among three "homelabbers" that wanted a more reliable location for hosting their servers. NRCC leases racks in datacenters, then passes along the opportunity for its members to purchase space.

# Membership

Membership is available for everyone. There is a $50 yearly membership fee associated. This fee enables a person to purchase rack-units of space at one of our datacenters.

## Hosting Fee

In addition to the $50 yearly membership fee, there is a hosting fee of $25 per rack unit per month. This fee is not mandatory - and only needs to be paid to lease space. All the other features of membership are available, even if you aren't placing equipment in our datacenters.

## Membership Benefits

Members of the NRCC enjoy a series of privileges, such as:
- Access to the NRCC community
- Addition to the NRCC mailing list
- An invitation to the NRCC Slack, exclusive for members
- Voting rights for policy, financial, and technical decisions

## Hosting Benefits

Those that choose to host a server (or multiple!) in one of our racks are given the following benefits:
- Space for your server in one of our racks
- One unfiltered network drop
- One out-of-band management network drop (for things like IPMI/iDRAC)
- A public IPv4 address per server
- Access to a dedicated channel in our Slack for those that lease rack units
