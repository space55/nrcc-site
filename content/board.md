NRCC is a member-owned cooperative, led by the three board members.

## Miles Macchiaroli

## Chris MacNaughton

Chris has always had a fascination with computers from both a hardware and software perspective. He built his first computer at age 12, and started exploring programming not long after. Chris can often be found tinkering with different kinds of hardware or exploring the inner workings of interconnected networks.

## Eamonn Nugent

Eamonn started programming from a young age, and quickly discovered homelabbing. With his first two servers purchased at fourteen, he taught himself Linux system administration, and was immediately hooked. He started running his own servers in a datacenter when the homelab outgrew his available space. Eamonn has a particular interest in tea and all things space-related.
